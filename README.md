# Python HTTP Server

This is a basic example of an HTTP server written in Python using Flask, which responds with "Hello World" on the root route (`/`).

## Description

The HTTP server is implemented using the Flask framework for Python. When the root route (`/`) is accessed, the server responds with "Hello World from Python!". If any other route is accessed, a "Page not found" message is displayed.

## Requirements

- Python (version 3.8 or higher)
- Flask (automatically installed in the Dockerfile)

## Installation and Execution

### Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-flask-server.git
   ```
## Improvements
- Add more routes and functionalities to the HTTP server.
- Implement a more advanced routing system.
- Add support for templates or views.
- Improve security and error handling.
